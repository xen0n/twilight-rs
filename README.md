# twilight-rs

This is a straight-forward port of Android's `TwilightCalculator`,
like [this one from LineageOS's sources][java-link], that one can use
to calculate sunrise and sunset times on a given time and location.

The public API is meant to be used together with [the `chrono` library][chrono].
